# üè¶ Loan Approval Prediction using Machine Learning
Welcome to the Loan Approval Prediction project ‚Äî a data-driven solution designed to assist financial institutions in automating and optimizing loan approval decisions. This project explores multiple machine learning models to predict whether a loan should be approved or rejected, based on an applicant's financial profile.
# Problem Statement
Traditional loan approval processes are time-consuming, prone to human bias, and often inconsistent. This project tackles these challenges by building a predictive system that analyzes key factors like:

- Credit score (CIBIL)
- Annual income
- Loan amount and term
- Asset values (residential, commercial, luxury)
- Employment and education status

The goal is to streamline approvals, reduce risk, and enhance decision fairness.

# Key Features
‚úÖ Cleaned and preprocessed dataset of 4,200+ applicants
üìä Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for insights and feature understanding
‚öôÔ∏è Feature engineering including asset consolidation into total_asset_value

# Six classification models implemented and tuned:

- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Neural Network
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Naive Bayes

## Performance evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC
## K-Means Clustering for customer segmentation

# Best Performing Model
- Random Forest emerged as the most effective model, achieving:
Accuracy: 98.59%
Precision & Recall: 99%
AUC: 0.98
Offers interpretability, robustness, and real-time scalability ‚Äî ideal for production environments.

# Use Case
Whether you're a data science enthusiast, a financial analyst, or a machine learning practitioner, this project offers a solid foundation for applying classification techniques to real-world finance problems. It can also serve as a blueprint for deploying predictive systems in other risk-based decision scenarios.
